<p>You already know how to create a dictionary and access its items. In this topic, you are going to learn about other features of dictionaries.</p>
<h5 id="alternative-dictionary-creation">Alternative dictionary creation</h5>
<p>You know that there are two ways to create a dictionary. Using <em>curly braces </em>with a comma-separated list of <code class="language-python">key: value</code> pairs or the <code class="language-python">dict</code> constructor. We will learn about the <code class="language-python">fromkeys</code> method that creates a new dictionary with specified keys and values. This is the syntax for this method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dict.fromkeys(keys, value)</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="language-python">keys</code> parameter is a sequence of elements that will become the keys of a new dictionary. The <code class="language-python">value</code> parameter is optional and defaults to <code class="language-python">None</code>, but the user can specify a value for all keys in the dictionary. Look at the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">planets = {'Venus', 'Earth', 'Jupiter'}  
  
# initializing by default with None 
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets)
print(planets_dict)  # {'Jupiter': None, 'Venus': None, 'Earth': None}

# initializing with a value
value = 'planet'
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets, value)
print(planets_dict)  # {'Earth': 'planet', 'Venus': 'planet', 'Jupiter': 'planet'}

# changing the value of 'Jupiter'
planets_dict['Jupiter'] = "giant " + planets_dict['Jupiter']
print(planets_dict)
 # {'Earth': 'planet', 'Venus': 'planet', 'Jupiter': 'giant planet'}</code></pre>
<p>The word was added successfully! But now we want to create a dictionary that would store the names of the satellites for those planets. Some planets have several satellites, and some do not have them at all, so it is more convenient to use a list as a value.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># some satellites of the Solar System
satellites = ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa']

# initializing with an empty list
planets_dict = dict.fromkeys(planets, [])
print(planets_dict)  # {'Jupiter': [], 'Venus': [], 'Earth': []}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's add the items from the <code class="language-python">satellites</code> list to the corresponding planets. Look, this is what happened to our dictionary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">planets_dict['Earth'].append(satellites[0])
planets_dict['Jupiter'].append(satellites[1])
planets_dict['Jupiter'].append(satellites[2])
print(planets_dict)  
# {'Jupiter': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa'], 'Venus': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa'], 'Earth': ['Moon', 'Io', 'Europa']}</code></pre>
<p>We see that all the elements of the <code class="language-python">satellites</code> list have been assigned to all planets in our dictionary. This happened because the <code class="language-python">fromkeys</code> method assigns the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/8077" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, same object refers to two or more variables that refer to the same location in memory, meaning they are pointing to the exact same object. | This is different from two variables having the same value, as they may still be referring to different objects in memory. You can check if two variables refer to the same object by using the built-in `is` operator, which returns `True` if the variables are the same object and `False` if they are not. However, it is important not to confuse the `is` operator with the equality operator (`==`), which checks if two objects have the same value.">same object</a> to all keys. While referring to different keys of the <code class="language-python">planets_dict</code> dictionary, we are still referring to the same list. The difference from the previous example is that if we use <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/9262" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a mutable object is an object whose state can be modified after it is created. | This is in contrast to immutable objects, such as strings or tuples, which, once created, cannot be changed. When you modify a mutable object, you are actually changing the object in place. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you are working with multiple variables that refer to the same mutable object. To avoid this, you can use shallow copying to create a copy of a mutable object, which will allow you to alter the original without changing the copy.">mutable objects</a> (a list, a dictionary) as values, all changes will also apply to our dictionary. The solution is to use the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11096" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a dictionary comprehension is a concise and memory-efficient way to create a new dictionary from an existing iterable object, such as a list or another dictionary. | It allows you to perform an operation on each element of the iterable and add it to the new dictionary, with the syntax similar to list comprehension. The operation can involve testing for membership in a dictionary, iterating over keys and including values in iteration, and sorting the resulting dictionary.">dictionary comprehension</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">planets_dict = {key: [] for key in planets}</code></pre>
<p>More details on this operation will be provided in another topic on dictionary operations.</p>
<h5 id="adding-items">Adding items</h5>
<p>Suppose we want to add items to an existing dictionary. You know one way to do it — define a new key and a new value: <code class="language-python">existing_dict['new key'] = 'new value'</code>. But there is another way — use the <code class="language-python">update</code> method. The method updates the dictionary with new elements from another dictionary or an iterable of <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/15401" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, a key-value pair is a data structure that maps unique keys to associated values in a dictionary. | Each key is used to look up its corresponding value within the dictionary. The key must be immutable and hashable, while the value can be any Python object and can vary in type. Key-value pairs are useful for creating flexible, unordered collections of data where each element has a unique identifier. They are often used in scenarios where fast lookups and efficient storage are important.">key-value pairs</a>.</p>
<p>Let's create a dictionary and define months as keys, and the average temperature for this month as values. So we have the following <code class="language-python">testable</code> dictionary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'} 
another_dictionary = {'June': '21°C'}

# adding items from another dictionary
testable.update(another_dictionary)
print(testable)  # {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'June': '21°C'}

# adding a key-value pair
testable.update(October='10°C')
print(testable)  
# {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C', 'June': '21°C', 'October': '10°C'}</code></pre>
<p>If the specified key already exists in the dictionary, the method will update the key with the new value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">testable = {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-10°C'}
testable.update(December='-20°C')

print(testable)  # {'September': '16°C', 'December': '-20°C'}</code></pre>
<p>With Python 3.10, you can use <code class="language-python">the union operator (|)</code> to merge two dictionaries. If a key appears in both operands, the value from the right-hand <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/5865" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Python, an operand is a value or variable on which an operation is performed. | In the context of the provided text, the operands are '3' and '5' in the expression '3 + 5', and the '+' sign is the operator. Operands can be of any data type, and the operation performed on them depends on the operator used. For example, arithmetic operators like '+' (addition), '-' (subtraction), '\*' (multiplication), and '/' (division) take numerical operands, while comparison operators like '&lt;' (less than) and '&gt;' (greater than) take operands that can be compared based on some order.">operand</a> prevails, overwriting any previous value associated with that key.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'b': 3, 'c': 4}

merged_dict = dict1 | dict2

print(merged_dict) # {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}</code></pre>
